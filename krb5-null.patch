Screen out interfaces which have no address in foreach_localaddr().  (Per man
pages for OpenBSD and OS/X, they are legal.)  If it doesn't have an address,
the functions which call this function (src/kdc/network.c, which wants to
listen on the interfaces, and src/lib/krb5/os/localaddr.c, which just wants a
list of local addresses), have no use for it anyway.

This is slightly different than the fix proposed by Paul Jakma at
http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/krb5-bugs/2004-January/002152.html, but is
more or less equivalent.

Don't worry, printifaddr() already checks that ifp->ifa_addr != NULL before
printing it.
